    <description>Hi,

I love the draft and have gone through it. The language itself is simple and basic - but there is one thing that you might consider adding that seems very relevant to your description of the language. You describe the language as:

&gt; But the compiler’s source or input language is a subset (or a simpli-
fied version) of TypeScript.

One thing that I think migh be important to some is the idea of reserved keywords (or in your language - there does not seem to be any). For example - in your language - I can do this:

&gt; var if = 10;

Which allows one to do this:
&gt; if (if == 10)

To some this might seem like a small thing - but I think by adding in a quick note about there not being any reserved keywords for variable names and the like - it would be helpful to others.</description>

            <p>Yes - that makes perfect sense to me.</p>
<p>I’d say that since this is supposed to be a simple language - a text explanation would be good enough.</p>
<p>I think that any more would overcomplicate this for just a quick language developed to show the process from beginning to end.</p>
<p>I wonder if having a section on “Future things you can do” would be a neat idea. This might make a good item for that section. Another might be related to selective case sensitivity for keywords/variables.</p>

            <p>To disallow code like <code>var if = 10</code> the identifier rule should be adjusted. You need to have one more primitive combinator, <code>notFollowedBy</code> that asserts that the source doesn’t match a rule (this is called <em>syntactic predicate</em> in PEG). So the identifier rule should be something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">let keyword = IF.or(ELSE).or(FUNCTION) // etc...
let id = notFollowedBy(keyword).and(ID)
</code></pre>
<p>I am a bit hesitant to introduce a whole new primitive combinator only to solve this problem. I’ll have to give this some thought. Maybe I can come up with something simpler. Or maybe, just a textual explanation of this problem will suffice.</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/nerdboy">@nerdboy</a>, and welcome!</p>
<p>That’s a very interesting observation. I will have to add some explanation to the book. Sometimes this behavior is advantageous, like when JS introduced <code>let</code> they had to make sure that the old code like <code>var let = 10</code> still works. But for other cases, this should be avoided, like in the <code>var if = 10</code> example you made.</p>
