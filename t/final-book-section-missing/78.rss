    <title>Final Book section missing?</title>
    <link>https://discourse.keleshev.com/t/final-book-section-missing/78</link>
    <description>Hi Vladimir,

I pulled the latest version of the book bcause the final version came out. I went looking at the table of contents and found one of the sections missing. The section was labelled as &quot;Optimizations&quot; (In the last pdf - it was listed under Part 2 as section 9).

I also checked the github tree and found that there at least one thing that would have been part of that section:
* Constant Folding

I wondered if you just forgot to put that in - or if this was on purpose as a &quot;exercise&quot; for people reading the book.</description>

            <p>I decided to cut the scope a little to fulfil the promise of getting it done before September ends. There are 10 more topics I wish I could cover but I would never release the book this way. However, if this particular topic has a lot of interest—I will write one more chapter and send an update.</p>
