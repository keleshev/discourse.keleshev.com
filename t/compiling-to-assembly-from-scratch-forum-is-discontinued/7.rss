    <description>Thank you those who participated and provided valuable feedback and discussion!

This forum did not see much use past the few months after the book launch, and hosting it requires non-negligible resources. That&#39;s why I&#39;m closing this forum, but keeping a scraped static version for posterity.

In case you are looking for a place to discuss your compiler, programming language, or the book, I suggest the following Reddit communities:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/Compilers/
* https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/

You can also contact me on Twitter [@keleshev](https://twitter.com/keleshev) and by email [vladimir@keleshev.com](mailto:vladimir@keleshev.com).
