    <title>Thank you page still mentions pre-order</title>
    <link>https://discourse.keleshev.com/t/thank-you-page-still-mentions-pre-order/84</link>
    <description>Hi! Thanks for writing this book. I just purchased it, and I believe this is after the pre-order period, but I noticed the `Thank you` page after purchasing still mentions `pre-order`.

&gt; Thank you for your pre-order! You will receive an email with a download link shortly.

This is certainly not a big deal, but just thought you might want to know. Thanks again! Looking forward to working through the book.</description>
